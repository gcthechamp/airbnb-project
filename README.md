# airbnb-project
This is a simple Springboot application which allows multiple features like adding a hotel to the database, adding a user to the database, booking of rooms in the hotel for the users, adding new facilities to the hotels, getting hotel with the most number of facilities and so on. It has been made using Java, Spring and maven. The IntelliJ IDE has been used to build the project. Postman was used to hit the APIs and test them. This is a small project which is mainly focused on learning backend skills using Spring and therefore hashmaps have been used as dummy databases for the project.
